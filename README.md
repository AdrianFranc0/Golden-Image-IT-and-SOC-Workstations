# Golden Image for IT and SOC Workstations
This lab simulates the creation of two standardized workstation images: one tailored for **IT Helpdesk** use and the other for a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst**. These virtual machines are preloaded with tools, security configurations, and environment-specific customizations. In enterprise environments, golden images are commonly used to deploy consistent, secure systems across multiple departments.

This project builds foundational experience in image provisioning, endpoint configuration, and role-based desktop environments.

> **Description**:  
> This screenshot shows the IT Helpdesk workstation with tools such as **Google Chrome**, **Thunderbird**, and **Outlook** preinstalled. These are common tools used for support-related tasks, email communication, and troubleshooting. The desktop reflects a ready-to-use environment for new IT technicians.

</p>

> **Description**:  
> The SOC Analyst image is loaded with tools like **Wireshark**, **Splunk**, and **CyberChef** — used for network analysis, log ingestion, and forensic encoding/decoding respectively. This environment reflects a SOC analyst's typical workflow and is optimized for immediate use in monitoring or investigation scenarios.

> **Description**:  
> This screenshot shows the login screen with two dedicated user accounts: one for the **IT role (ITuser01)** and another for the **SOC analyst (SOCanalyst01)**. Each account is tied to its corresponding image, reinforcing role separation and allowing specific apps and GPOs to be tied to each environment.

## ✅ Summary

This golden image project demonstrates practical provisioning skills for enterprise endpoints. It shows how to build standardized environments tailored for different roles while maintaining usability and security. This experience aligns closely with real-world IT support and cybersecurity operations practices.
thanks for taking a look at my project :)
